Ashkbiz Danehkar is a Research Scientist in Astrophysics at Eureka Scientific supported by a NASA grant. His research interests include observational and theoretical astrophysics of ionized nebulae, symbiotics, AGN, and starbursts, using multi-wavelength optical, UV and X-ray spectroscopic and imaging observations.

To perform his research, he uses plasma diagnostics, abundance analysis, photoionization modeling, hydrodynamic simulations, and 3D morpho-kinematic modeling.
