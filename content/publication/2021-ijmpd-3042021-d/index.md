abstract: In the holographic picture, the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism in d-dimensional
  Yang-Mills theories is conjectured to provide a Higgs-like mechanism for gravity
  in d + 1 dimensions, resulting in massive (or massless) gravitons in IR (or UV)
  completions. Accordingly, one could imagine dual (magnetic-type) fields of massive
  gravitons in the IR (low-energy) limit that are coupled to the curl of their own
  energy-momentum, as well as to the rotation of matter fields on large scales. This
  hypothesis, which might solve cosmological issues currently ascribed to dark matter
  and dark energy, needs to be examined by the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
  mission using observations of gravitational waves emitted from extragalactic sources.
