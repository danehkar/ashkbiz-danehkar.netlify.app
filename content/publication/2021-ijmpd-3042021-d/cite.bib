 abstract = {In the holographic picture, the Brout-Englert-Higgs (BEH) mechanism in
d-dimensional Yang-Mills theories is conjectured to provide a
Higgs-like mechanism for gravity in d + 1 dimensions, resulting
in massive (or massless) gravitons in IR (or UV) completions.
Accordingly, one could imagine dual (magnetic-type) fields of
massive gravitons in the IR (low-energy) limit that are coupled
to the curl of their own energy-momentum, as well as to the
rotation of matter fields on large scales. This hypothesis,
which might solve cosmological issues currently ascribed to dark
matter and dark energy, needs to be examined by the future Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna mission using observations of
gravitational waves emitted from extragalactic sources.},
