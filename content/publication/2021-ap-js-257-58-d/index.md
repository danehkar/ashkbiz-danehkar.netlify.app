abstract: Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) and weak-emission-line (wels) central stars of planetary
  nebulae (PNs) have hydrogen-deficient atmospheres, whose origins are not well understood.
  In the present study, we have conducted plasma diagnostics and abundance analyses
  of 18 Galactic PNs surrounding [WR] and wels nuclei, using collisionally excited
  lines (CELs) and optical recombination lines (ORLs) measured with the Wide Field
  Spectrograph on the Australian National University 2.3 m telescope at the Siding
  Spring Observatory complemented with optical archival data. Our plasma diagnostics
  imply that the electron densities and temperatures derived from CELs are correlated
  with the intrinsic nebular Hensuremathβ surface brightness and excitation class,
  respectively. Self-consistent plasma diagnostics of heavy-element ORLs of N$^2+$
  and O$^2+$ suggest that a small fraction of cool (ensuremathłesssim7000 K), dense
  (åisebox-0.5ex~10$^4$-10$^5$ cm$^-3$) materials may be present in some objects,
  though with large uncertainties. Our abundance analyses indicate that the abundance
  discrepancy factors (ADFs ensuremath≡ ORLs/CELs) of O$^2+$ are correlated with the
  dichotomies between forbidden-line and He I temperatures. Our results likely point
  to the presence of a tiny fraction of cool, oxygen-rich dense clumps within diffuse
  warm ionized nebulae. Moreover, our elemental abundances derived from CELs are mostly
  consistent with asymptotic giant branch models in the range of initial masses from
  1.5 to 5 M $_ensuremathødot$. Further studies are necessary to understand better
  the origins of abundance discrepancies in PNs around [WR] and wels stars.
