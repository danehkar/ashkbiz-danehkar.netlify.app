 abstract = {Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) and weak-emission-line (wels) central stars of
planetary nebulae (PNs) have hydrogen-deficient atmospheres,
whose origins are not well understood. In the present study, we
have conducted plasma diagnostics and abundance analyses of 18
Galactic PNs surrounding [WR] and wels nuclei, using
collisionally excited lines (CELs) and optical recombination
lines (ORLs) measured with the Wide Field Spectrograph on the
Australian National University 2.3 m telescope at the Siding
Spring Observatory complemented with optical archival data. Our
plasma diagnostics imply that the electron densities and
temperatures derived from CELs are correlated with the intrinsic
nebular H\ensuremathβ surface brightness and excitation
class, respectively. Self-consistent plasma diagnostics of
heavy-element ORLs of N$^2+$ and O$^2+$ suggest that a small
fraction of cool (\ensuremathłesssim7000 K), dense
(åisebox-0.5ex~10$^4$-10$^5$
cm$^-3$) materials may be present in some objects, though with
large uncertainties. Our abundance analyses indicate that the
abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs \ensuremath≡
ORLs/CELs) of O$^2+$ are correlated with the dichotomies
between forbidden-line and He I temperatures. Our results likely
point to the presence of a tiny fraction of cool, oxygen-rich
dense clumps within diffuse warm ionized nebulae. Moreover, our
elemental abundances derived from CELs are mostly consistent
with asymptotic giant branch models in the range of initial
masses from 1.5 to 5 M $_\ensuremathødot$. Further
studies are necessary to understand better the origins of
abundance discrepancies in PNs around [WR] and wels stars.},
