 abstract = {The nonlinear propagation of electrostatic solitary waves is studied in
a collisionless electron-positron pair plasma consisting of
adiabatic cool electrons, mobile cool positrons (or electron
holes), hot suprathermal electrons described by a
\ensuremathąppa distribution, and stationary ions. The
linear dispersion relation derived for electrostatic waves
demonstrates a weak dependence of the phase speed on physical
conditions of positrons in appropriate ranges of parameters. The
Sagdeev's pseudopotential approach is used to obtain the
existence of electrostatic solitary wave structures, focusing on
how their characteristics depend on the physical conditions of
positrons and suprathermal electrons. Both negative and positive
polarity electrostatic solitary waves are found to exist in
different ranges of Mach numbers. As the positrons constitute a
small fraction of the total number density, they slightly affect
the existence domains. However, the positrons can significantly
change the wave potential at a fixed soliton speed. The results
indicate that the positive potential can largely be grown by
increasing the electron suprathermality (lower
\ensuremath\p̨pa) at a fixed true Mach number. It is found
that a fraction of positrons maintain the generation of positive
polarity electrostatic solitary waves in the presence of
suprathermal electrons in pair plasmas.},
