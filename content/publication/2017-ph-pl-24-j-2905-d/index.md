abstract: The nonlinear propagation of electrostatic solitary waves is studied in
  a collisionless electron-positron pair plasma consisting of adiabatic cool electrons,
  mobile cool positrons (or electron holes), hot suprathermal electrons described
  by a ensuremathąppa distribution, and stationary ions. The linear dispersion relation
  derived for electrostatic waves demonstrates a weak dependence of the phase speed
  on physical conditions of positrons in appropriate ranges of parameters. The Sagdeev's
  pseudopotential approach is used to obtain the existence of electrostatic solitary
  wave structures, focusing on how their characteristics depend on the physical conditions
  of positrons and suprathermal electrons. Both negative and positive polarity electrostatic
  solitary waves are found to exist in different ranges of Mach numbers. As the positrons
  constitute a small fraction of the total number density, they slightly affect the
  existence domains. However, the positrons can significantly change the wave potential
  at a fixed soliton speed. The results indicate that the positive potential can largely
  be grown by increasing the electron suprathermality (lower ensuremathp̨pa) at a
  fixed true Mach number. It is found that a fraction of positrons maintain the generation
  of positive polarity electrostatic solitary waves in the presence of suprathermal
  electrons in pair plasmas.
