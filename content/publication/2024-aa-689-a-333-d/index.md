abstract: Context. Lyman break analogs in the local Universe serve as counterparts
  to Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at high redshifts, which are widely regarded as major
  contributors to cosmic reionization in the early stages of the Universe. Aims. We
  studied XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the nearby LBG analog Haro 11, which
  contains two X-ray-bright sources, X1 and X2. Both sources exhibit Lyman continuum
  (LyC) leakage, particularly X2. Methods. We analyzed the X-ray variability using
  principal component analysis (PCA) and performed spectral modeling of the X1 and
  X2 observations made with the Chandra ACIS-S instrument. Results. The PCA component,
  which contributes to the X-ray variability, is apparently associated with variable
  emission features, likely from ionized superwinds. Our spectral analysis of the
  Chandra data indicates that the fainter X-ray source, X2 (X-ray luminosity L$_X$
  ensuremath∼ 4 × 10$^40$ erg s$^‑1$), the one with higher LyC leakage, has a much
  lower absorbing column (N$_H$ ensuremath∼ 1.2 × 10$^21$ cm$^‑2$) than the heavily
  absorbed luminous source X1 (L$_X$ ensuremath∼ 9 × 10$^40$ erg s$^‑1$ and N$_H$
  ensuremath∼ 11.5 × 10$^21$ cm$^‑2$). Conclusions. We conclude that X2 is likely
  less covered by absorbing material, which may be a result of powerful superwinds
  clearing galactic channels and facilitating the escape of LyC radiation. Much deeper
  X-ray observations are required to validate the presence of potential superwinds
  and determine their implications for the LyC escape.
