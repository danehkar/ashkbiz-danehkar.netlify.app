 abstract = {Context. Lyman break analogs in the local Universe serve as counterparts
to Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at high redshifts, which are
widely regarded as major contributors to cosmic reionization in
the early stages of the Universe. Aims. We studied XMM-Newton
and Chandra observations of the nearby LBG analog Haro 11, which
contains two X-ray-bright sources, X1 and X2. Both sources
exhibit Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage, particularly X2. Methods.
We analyzed the X-ray variability using principal component
analysis (PCA) and performed spectral modeling of the X1 and X2
observations made with the Chandra ACIS-S instrument. Results.
The PCA component, which contributes to the X-ray variability,
is apparently associated with variable emission features, likely
from ionized superwinds. Our spectral analysis of the Chandra
data indicates that the fainter X-ray source, X2 (X-ray
luminosity L$_X$ \ensuremath∼ 4 ×
10$^40$ erg s$^‑1$), the one with higher LyC leakage, has
a much lower absorbing column (N$_H$ \ensuremath∼ 1.2
× 10$^21$ cm$^‑2$) than the heavily absorbed
luminous source X1 (L$_X$ \ensuremath∼ 9 ×
10$^40$ erg s$^‑1$ and N$_H$ \ensuremath∼ 11.5
× 10$^21$ cm$^‑2$). Conclusions. We conclude
that X2 is likely less covered by absorbing material, which may
be a result of powerful superwinds clearing galactic channels
and facilitating the escape of LyC radiation. Much deeper X-ray
observations are required to validate the presence of potential
superwinds and determine their implications for the LyC escape.},
