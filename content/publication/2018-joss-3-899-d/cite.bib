 abstract = {The emission lines emitted from gaseous nebulae carry valuable
information about the physical conditions and chemical
abundances of ionized gases in these objects, as well as the
interstellar extinction. ``proEQUIB'' is a library containing
several application programming interface (API) functions
developed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL), which can be
used for plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis of nebular
spectra. This IDL library can also be used by the GNU Data
Language (GDL), which is a free and open-source IDL compiler.
This package includes several API functions to determine
physical conditions and chemical abundances from collisionally
excited lines (CEL) and recombination lines (RL), derive
interstellar extinctions from Balmer lines, and deredden the
observed fluxes. This IDL library heavily relies on the IDL
Astronomy User's library and the IDL ``AtomNeb'' library. The
API functions of this IDL library can easily be utilized for
spatially-resolved studies of ionized gaseous nebulae observed
using integral field spectroscopy.},
