abstract: The emission lines emitted from gaseous nebulae carry valuable information
  about the physical conditions and chemical abundances of ionized gases in these
  objects, as well as the interstellar extinction. ``proEQUIB'' is a library containing
  several application programming interface (API) functions developed in the Interactive
  Data Language (IDL), which can be used for plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis
  of nebular spectra. This IDL library can also be used by the GNU Data Language (GDL),
  which is a free and open-source IDL compiler. This package includes several API
  functions to determine physical conditions and chemical abundances from collisionally
  excited lines (CEL) and recombination lines (RL), derive interstellar extinctions
  from Balmer lines, and deredden the observed fluxes. This IDL library heavily relies
  on the IDL Astronomy User's library and the IDL ``AtomNeb'' library. The API functions
  of this IDL library can easily be utilized for spatially-resolved studies of ionized
  gaseous nebulae observed using integral field spectroscopy.
