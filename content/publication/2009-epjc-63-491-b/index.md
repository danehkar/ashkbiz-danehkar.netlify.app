abstract: Under some plausible assumptions, we find that the dual formulation of linearized
  gravity in D=5 can be nontrivially coupled to the topological BF model in such a
  way that the interacting theory exhibits a deformed gauge algebra and some deformed,
  on-shell reducibility relations. Moreover, the tensor field with the mixed symmetry
  (2,1) gains some shift gauge transformations with parameters from the BF sector.
