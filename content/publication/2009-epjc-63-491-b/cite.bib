 abstract = {Under some plausible assumptions, we find that the dual formulation of
linearized gravity in D=5 can be nontrivially coupled to the
topological BF model in such a way that the interacting theory
exhibits a deformed gauge algebra and some deformed, on-shell
reducibility relations. Moreover, the tensor field with the
mixed symmetry (2,1) gains some shift gauge transformations with
parameters from the BF sector.},
