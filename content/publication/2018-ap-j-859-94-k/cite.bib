 abstract = {Prompted by the H I Ly\ensuremathα absorption associated with
the X-ray ultrafast outflow at -17,300 km/s in the quasar
PG 1211+143, we have searched archival UV spectra at the
expected locations of H I Ly\ensuremathα absorption for
a large sample of ultrafast outflows identified in XMM-Newton
and Suzaku observations. Sixteen of the X-ray outflows have
predicted H I Ly\ensuremathα wavelengths falling within
the bandpass of spectra from either the Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer or the Hubble Space Telescope, although
none of the archival observations were simultaneous with the
X-ray observations in which ultrafast X-ray outflows (UFOs) were
detected. In our spectra broad features with FWHM of 1000 km/
s have 2\ensuremathσ upper limits on the H I
column density of generally \ensuremathłesssim2
× 10^13 cm^-2. Using grids of
photoionization models covering a broad range of spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), we find that producing Fe XXVI
Ly\ensuremathα X-ray absorption with equivalent widths
>30 eV and associated H I Ly\ensuremathα absorption. 
Nevertheless, a wide range of SEDs
would predict observable H I Ly\ensuremathα absorption
if ionization parameters are only slightly below peak ionization
fractions for Fe XXV and Fe XXVI. The lack of
Ly\ensuremathα features in the archival UV spectra
indicates that the UFOs have very high ionization parameters,
that they have very hard UV-ionizing spectra, or that they were
not present at the time of the UV spectral observations owing to
variability.},
