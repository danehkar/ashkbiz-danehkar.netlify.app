abstract: Prompted by the H I Lyensuremathα absorption associated with the X-ray ultrafast
  outflow at -17,300 km/s in the quasar PG 1211+143, we have searched archival UV
  spectra at the expected locations of H I Lyensuremathα absorption for a large sample
  of ultrafast outflows identified in XMM-Newton and Suzaku observations. Sixteen
  of the X-ray outflows have predicted H I Lyensuremathα wavelengths falling within
  the bandpass of spectra from either the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer or
  the Hubble Space Telescope, although none of the archival observations were simultaneous
  with the X-ray observations in which ultrafast X-ray outflows (UFOs) were detected.
  In our spectra broad features with FWHM of 1000 km/ s have 2ensuremathσ upper limits
  on the H I column density of generally ensuremathłesssim2 × 10^13 cm^-2. Using grids
  of photoionization models covering a broad range of spectral energy distributions
  (SEDs), we find that producing Fe XXVI Lyensuremathα X-ray absorption with equivalent
  widths >30 eV and associated H I Lyensuremathα absorption.  Nevertheless, a wide
  range of SEDs would predict observable H I Lyensuremathα absorption if ionization
  parameters are only slightly below peak ionization fractions for Fe XXV and Fe XXVI.
  The lack of Lyensuremathα features in the archival UV spectra indicates that the
  UFOs have very high ionization parameters, that they have very hard UV-ionizing
  spectra, or that they were not present at the time of the UV spectral observations
  owing to variability.
