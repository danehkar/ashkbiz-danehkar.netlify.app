abstract: The Weyl curvature includes the Newtonian field and an additional field,
  the so-called anti-Newtonian. In this paper, we use the Bianchi and Ricci identities
  to provide a set of constraints and propagations for the Weyl fields. The temporal
  evolutions of propagations manifest explicit solutions of gravitational waves. We
  see that models with purely Newtonian field are inconsistent with relativistic models
  and obstruct sounding solutions. Therefore, both fields are necessary for the nonlocal
  nature and radiative solutions of gravitation.
