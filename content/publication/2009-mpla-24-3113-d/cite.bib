 abstract = {The Weyl curvature includes the Newtonian field and an additional field,
the so-called anti-Newtonian. In this paper, we use the Bianchi
and Ricci identities to provide a set of constraints and
propagations for the Weyl fields. The temporal evolutions of
propagations manifest explicit solutions of gravitational waves.
We see that models with purely Newtonian field are inconsistent
with relativistic models and obstruct sounding solutions.
Therefore, both fields are necessary for the nonlocal nature and
radiative solutions of gravitation.},
