abstract: Spatially resolved observations of the planetary nebula M2-42 (PN G008.2-04.8)
  obtained with the Wide Field Spectrograph on the Australian National University
  2.3 m telescope have revealed the remarkable features of bipolar collimated jets
  emerging from its main structure. Velocity-resolved channel maps derived from the
  [N II] ensuremathłambda6584 emission line disentangle different morphological components
  of the nebula. This information is used to develop a three-dimensional morpho- kinematic
  model, which consists of an equatorial dense torus and a pair of asymmetric bipolar
  outflows. The expansion velocity of about 20 km s$^-1$ is measured from the spectrum
  integrated over the main shell. However, the deprojected velocities of the jets
  are found to be in the range of 80-160 km s$^-1$ with respect to the nebular center.
  It is found that the mean density of the collimated outflows, 595 ensuremath± 125
  cm$^-3$, is five times lower than that of the main shell, 3150 cm$^-3$, whereas
  their singly ionized nitrogen and sulfur abundances are about three times higher
  than those determined from the dense shell. The results indicate that the features
  of the collimated jets are typical of fast, low-ionization emission regions.
