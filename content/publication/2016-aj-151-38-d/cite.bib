 abstract = {Spatially resolved observations of the planetary nebula M2-42 (PN
G008.2-04.8) obtained with the Wide Field Spectrograph on the
Australian National University 2.3 m telescope have revealed the
remarkable features of bipolar collimated jets emerging from its
main structure. Velocity-resolved channel maps derived from the
[N II] \ensuremathłambda6584 emission line disentangle
different morphological components of the nebula. This
information is used to develop a three-dimensional morpho-
kinematic model, which consists of an equatorial dense torus and
a pair of asymmetric bipolar outflows. The expansion velocity of
about 20 km s$^-1$ is measured from the spectrum integrated
over the main shell. However, the deprojected velocities of the
jets are found to be in the range of 80-160 km s$^-1$ with
respect to the nebular center. It is found that the mean density
of the collimated outflows, 595 \ensuremath± 125
cm$^-3$, is five times lower than that of the main shell, 3150
cm$^-3$, whereas their singly ionized nitrogen and sulfur
abundances are about three times higher than those determined
from the dense shell. The results indicate that the features of
the collimated jets are typical of fast, low-ionization emission
regions.},
