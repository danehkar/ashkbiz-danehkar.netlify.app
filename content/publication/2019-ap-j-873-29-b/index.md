abstract: We present the spectral analysis of Chandra/High Energy Transmission Grating
  Spectrometer (HETGS) and NuSTAR observations of the quasar PDS 456 from 2015, and
  XMM-Newton and NuSTAR archival data from 2013 to 2014, together with Chandra/HETGS
  data from 2003. We analyzed these three different epochs in a consistent way, looking
  for absorption features corresponding to highly ionized blueshifted absorption lines
  from H-like and He-like ions of iron (and nickel), as well as of other elements
  (O, Ne, Si, and S) in the soft band. We confirm the presence of a persistent ultra-fast
  outflow (UFO) with a velocity of v $_out$ = -0.24 to -0.29 c, that has previously
  been detected. We also report the detection of an additional faster component of
  the UFO with a relativistic velocity of v $_out$ = -0.48 c. We implemented photoionization
  modeling, using XSTAR analytic model warmabs, to characterize the physical properties
  of the different kinematic components of the UFO and of the partially covering absorber
  detected in PDS 456. These two relativistic components of the UFO observed in the
  three epochs analyzed in this paper are powerful enough to impact the host galaxy
  of PDS 456 through feedback from active galactic nuclei.
