 abstract = {We present the spectral analysis of Chandra/High Energy Transmission
Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) and NuSTAR observations of the
quasar PDS 456 from 2015, and XMM-Newton and NuSTAR archival
data from 2013 to 2014, together with Chandra/HETGS data from
2003. We analyzed these three different epochs in a consistent
way, looking for absorption features corresponding to highly
ionized blueshifted absorption lines from H-like and He-like
ions of iron (and nickel), as well as of other elements (O, Ne,
Si, and S) in the soft band. We confirm the presence of a
persistent ultra-fast outflow (UFO) with a velocity of v
$_out$ = -0.24 to -0.29 c, that has previously been detected.
We also report the detection of an additional faster component
of the UFO with a relativistic velocity of v $_out$ = -0.48 c.
We implemented photoionization modeling, using XSTAR analytic
model warmabs, to characterize the physical properties of the
different kinematic components of the UFO and of the partially
covering absorber detected in PDS 456. These two relativistic
components of the UFO observed in the three epochs analyzed in
this paper are powerful enough to impact the host galaxy of PDS
456 through feedback from active galactic nuclei.},
