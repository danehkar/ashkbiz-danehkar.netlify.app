abstract: X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveal relativistic
  reflections from the innermost regions of accretion disks, which contain general-relativistic
  footprints caused by spinning supermassive black holes (SMBH). We anticipate the
  spin of a SMBH to be stable over the human timeframe, so brightness changes in the
  high-energy corona above the SMBH should slightly alter relativistic reflection.
  In this brief review, we discuss the latest developments in modeling relativistic
  reflection, as well as the rapid small variation in relativistic emission disclosed
  by the principal component analysis (PCA) of X-ray variability in AGN. PCA studies
  of X-ray spectra from AGNs have shown that relativistically blurred reflection has
  negligible fluctuations over the course of observations, which could originate from
  rapid (intrahour) intrinsic variations in near- horizon accretion flows and photon
  rings. The PCA technique is an effective way to disclose relativistic reflection
  from X-ray observations of AGNs, simplifying the complexity of largely variable
  X-ray data for automated spectral analysis with machine learning algorithms.
