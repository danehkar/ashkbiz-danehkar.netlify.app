 abstract = {X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveal relativistic
reflections from the innermost regions of accretion disks, which
contain general-relativistic footprints caused by spinning
supermassive black holes (SMBH). We anticipate the spin of a
SMBH to be stable over the human timeframe, so brightness
changes in the high-energy corona above the SMBH should slightly
alter relativistic reflection. In this brief review, we discuss
the latest developments in modeling relativistic reflection, as
well as the rapid small variation in relativistic emission
disclosed by the principal component analysis (PCA) of X-ray
variability in AGN. PCA studies of X-ray spectra from AGNs have
shown that relativistically blurred reflection has negligible
fluctuations over the course of observations, which could
originate from rapid (intrahour) intrinsic variations in near-
horizon accretion flows and photon rings. The PCA technique is
an effective way to disclose relativistic reflection from X-ray
observations of AGNs, simplifying the complexity of largely
variable X-ray data for automated spectral analysis with machine
learning algorithms.},
