 abstract = {We describe a program for the parallel implementation of multiple runs
of XSTAR, a photoionization code that is used to predict the
physical properties of an ionized gas from its emission and/or
absorption lines. The parallelization program, called
MPI_XSTAR, has been developed and implemented in the C++
language by using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol,
a conventional standard of parallel computing. We have
benchmarked parallel multiprocessing executions of XSTAR, using
MPI_XSTAR, against a serial execution of XSTAR, in terms of the
parallelization speedup and the computing resource efficiency.
Our experience indicates that the parallel execution runs
significantly faster than the serial execution, however, the
efficiency in terms of the computing resource usage decreases
with increasing the number of processors used in the parallel
computing.},
