abstract: Recent observations reveal that the central star of the planetary nebula
  Abell 48 exhibits spectral features similar to massive nitrogen- sequence Wolf-Rayet
  stars. This raises a pertinent question, whether it is still a planetary nebula
  or rather a ring nebula of a massive star. In this study, we have constructed a
  three- dimensional photoionization model of Abell 48, constrained by our new optical
  integral field spectroscopy. An analysis of the spatially resolved velocity distributions
  allowed us to constrain the geometry of Abell 48. We used the collisionally excited
  lines to obtain the nebular physical conditions and ionic abundances of nitrogen,
  oxygen, neon, sulphur and argon, relative to hydrogen. We also determined helium
  temperatures and ionic abundances of helium and carbon from the optical recombination
  lines. We obtained a good fit to the observations for most of the emission-line
  fluxes in our photoionization model. The ionic abundances deduced from our model
  are in decent agreement with those derived by the empirical analysis. However, we
  notice obvious discrepancies between helium temperatures derived from the model
  and the empirical analysis, as overestimated by our model. This could be due to
  the presence of a small fraction of cold metal-rich structures, which were not included
  in our model. It is found that the observed nebular line fluxes were best reproduced
  by using a hydrogen-deficient expanding model atmosphere as the ionizing source
  with an effective temperature of T$_eff$ = 70 kK and a stellar luminosity of L$_ensuremath⋆$
  = 5500 L$_☉$, which corresponds to a relatively low-mass progenitor star (ensuremath∼3
  M$_☉$) rather than a massive Pop I star.
