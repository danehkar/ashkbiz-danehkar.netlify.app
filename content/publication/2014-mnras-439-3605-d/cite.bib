 abstract = {Recent observations reveal that the central star of the planetary nebula
Abell 48 exhibits spectral features similar to massive nitrogen-
sequence Wolf-Rayet stars. This raises a pertinent question,
whether it is still a planetary nebula or rather a ring nebula
of a massive star. In this study, we have constructed a three-
dimensional photoionization model of Abell 48, constrained by
our new optical integral field spectroscopy. An analysis of the
spatially resolved velocity distributions allowed us to
constrain the geometry of Abell 48. We used the collisionally
excited lines to obtain the nebular physical conditions and
ionic abundances of nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulphur and argon,
relative to hydrogen. We also determined helium temperatures and
ionic abundances of helium and carbon from the optical
recombination lines. We obtained a good fit to the observations
for most of the emission-line fluxes in our photoionization
model. The ionic abundances deduced from our model are in decent
agreement with those derived by the empirical analysis. However,
we notice obvious discrepancies between helium temperatures
derived from the model and the empirical analysis, as
overestimated by our model. This could be due to the presence of
a small fraction of cold metal-rich structures, which were not
included in our model. It is found that the observed nebular
line fluxes were best reproduced by using a hydrogen-deficient
expanding model atmosphere as the ionizing source with an
effective temperature of T$_eff$ = 70 kK and a stellar
luminosity of L$_\ensuremath⋆$ = 5500 L$_☉$, which
corresponds to a relatively low-mass progenitor star
(\ensuremath∼3 M$_☉$) rather than a massive Pop I star.},
