abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of electron-acoustic localized structures in a collisionless
  and unmagnetized plasma consisting of ``cool`` inertial electrons, ``hot'' electrons
  having a kappa distribution, and stationary ions is studied. The inertialess hot
  electron distribution thus has a long-tailed suprathermal (non-Maxwellian) form.
  A dispersion relation is derived for linear electron-acoustic waves. They show a
  strong dependence of the charge screening mechanism on excess suprathermality (through
  ensuremathąppa). A nonlinear pseudopotential technique is employed to investigate
  the occurrence of stationary-profile solitary waves, focusing on how their characteristics
  depend on the spectral index ensuremathp̨pa, and the hot-to-cool electron temperature
  and density ratios. Only negative polarity solitary waves are found to exist, in
  a parameter region which becomes narrower as deviation from the Maxwellian (suprathermality)
  increases, while the soliton amplitude at fixed soliton speed increases. However,
  for a constant value of the true Mach number, the amplitude decreases for decreasing
  ensuremathkp̨a.
