 abstract = {The nonlinear dynamics of electron-acoustic localized structures in a
collisionless and unmagnetized plasma consisting of ``cool``
inertial electrons, ``hot'' electrons having a kappa
distribution, and stationary ions is studied. The inertialess
hot electron distribution thus has a long-tailed suprathermal
(non-Maxwellian) form. A dispersion relation is derived for
linear electron-acoustic waves. They show a strong dependence of
the charge screening mechanism on excess suprathermality
(through \ensuremathąppa). A nonlinear pseudopotential
technique is employed to investigate the occurrence of
stationary-profile solitary waves, focusing on how their
characteristics depend on the spectral index
\ensuremath\p̨pa, and the hot-to-cool electron temperature
and density ratios. Only negative polarity solitary waves are
found to exist, in a parameter region which becomes narrower as
deviation from the Maxwellian (suprathermality) increases, while
the soliton amplitude at fixed soliton speed increases. However,
for a constant value of the true Mach number, the amplitude
decreases for decreasing \ensuremath\kp̨a.},
