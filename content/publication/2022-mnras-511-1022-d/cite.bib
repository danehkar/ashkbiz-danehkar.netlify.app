 abstract = {The planetary nebula (PN) Abell 48 (PN G029.0+00.4) is around a rare
Wolf-Rayet [WN5] star whose stellar history is as yet unknown.
Using the integral field observations of the H
\ensuremathα\ensuremathłambda6563 and [N II]
\ensuremathłambda6584 line emissions, we conducted a
comprehensive spatio-kinematic analysis of this PN. A three-
dimensional spatio-kinematic ionization model was developed with
the kinematic modelling tool SHAPE to replicate the observed
spatially resolved velocity channels and position-velocity
diagrams. According to our kinematic analysis of the H
\ensuremathα emission, this object possesses a deformed
elliptic toroidal shell with an outer radius of 23 arcsec and a
thickness of 15 arcsec associated with an integrated H
\ensuremathα emission-line expansion of
åisebox-0.5ex~35 \ensuremath± 5 km
s$^-1$, a maximum poloidal expansion of around 70
\ensuremath± 20 km s$^-1$ at an inclination angle of
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~30° with respect to
the line of sight, and a position angle of
\rs̊ebox-0.5ex~130° measured from
east towards north in the equatorial coordinate system.
Furthermore, [N II] kinematic modelling reveals the presence of
narrow (\rae̊box-0.5ex~3 arcsec) exterior low-
ionization structures surrounding the main elliptical shell,
which could have formed as a result of shock collisions with the
interstellar medium. The torus-shaped morphology of this PN
could be related to its unusual hydrogen-deficient [WN] nucleus
that needs to be inspected further.},
