abstract: The planetary nebula (PN) Abell 48 (PN G029.0+00.4) is around a rare Wolf-Rayet
  [WN5] star whose stellar history is as yet unknown. Using the integral field observations
  of the H ensuremathαensuremathłambda6563 and [N II] ensuremathłambda6584 line emissions,
  we conducted a comprehensive spatio-kinematic analysis of this PN. A three- dimensional
  spatio-kinematic ionization model was developed with the kinematic modelling tool
  SHAPE to replicate the observed spatially resolved velocity channels and position-velocity
  diagrams. According to our kinematic analysis of the H ensuremathα emission, this
  object possesses a deformed elliptic toroidal shell with an outer radius of 23 arcsec
  and a thickness of 15 arcsec associated with an integrated H ensuremathα emission-line
  expansion of åisebox-0.5ex~35 ensuremath± 5 km s$^-1$, a maximum poloidal expansion
  of around 70 ensuremath± 20 km s$^-1$ at an inclination angle of i̊sebox-0.5ex~30°
  with respect to the line of sight, and a position angle of rs̊ebox-0.5ex~130° measured
  from east towards north in the equatorial coordinate system. Furthermore, [N II]
  kinematic modelling reveals the presence of narrow (rae̊box-0.5ex~3 arcsec) exterior
  low- ionization structures surrounding the main elliptical shell, which could have
  formed as a result of shock collisions with the interstellar medium. The torus-shaped
  morphology of this PN could be related to its unusual hydrogen-deficient [WN] nucleus
  that needs to be inspected further.
