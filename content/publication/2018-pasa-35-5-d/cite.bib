 abstract = {The planetary nebula PB 8 around a [WN/WC]-hybrid central star is one of
planetary nebulae with moderate abundance discrepancy factors
(ADFs 2-3), which could be an indication of a tiny fraction of
metal-rich inclusions embedded in the nebula (bi-abundance). In
this work, we have constructed photoionisation models to
reproduce the optical and infrared observations of the planetary
nebula PB 8 using a non-LTE stellar model atmosphere ionising
source. A chemically homogeneous model initially used cannot
predict the optical recombination lines. However, a bi-abundance
model provides a better fit to most of the observed optical
recombination lines from N and O ions. The metal-rich inclusions
in the bi-abundance model occupy 5.6% of the total volume of
the nebula, and are roughly 1.7 times cooler and denser than the
mean values of the surrounding nebula. The N/H and O/H abundance
ratios in the metal-rich inclusions are 1.0 and 1.7 dex larger
than the diffuse warm nebula, respectively. To reproduce the
Spitzer spectral energy distribution of PB 8, dust grains with a
dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01 (by mass) were also included. It is
found that the presence of metal-rich inclusions can explain the
heavy element optical recombination lines, while a dual-dust
chemistry with different grain species and discrete grain sizes
likely produces the infrared continuum of this planetary nebula.
This study demonstrates that the bi-abundance hypothesis, which
was examined in a few planetary nebulae with large abundance
discrepancies (ADFs $\gt$ 10), could also be applied to those
typical planetary nebulae with moderate abundance discrepancies.},
