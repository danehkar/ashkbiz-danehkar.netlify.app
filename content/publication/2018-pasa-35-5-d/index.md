abstract: The planetary nebula PB 8 around a [WN/WC]-hybrid central star is one of
  planetary nebulae with moderate abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs 2-3), which
  could be an indication of a tiny fraction of metal-rich inclusions embedded in the
  nebula (bi-abundance). In this work, we have constructed photoionisation models
  to reproduce the optical and infrared observations of the planetary nebula PB 8
  using a non-LTE stellar model atmosphere ionising source. A chemically homogeneous
  model initially used cannot predict the optical recombination lines. However, a
  bi-abundance model provides a better fit to most of the observed optical recombination
  lines from N and O ions. The metal-rich inclusions in the bi-abundance model occupy
  5.6% of the total volume of the nebula, and are roughly 1.7 times cooler and denser
  than the mean values of the surrounding nebula. The N/H and O/H abundance ratios
  in the metal-rich inclusions are 1.0 and 1.7 dex larger than the diffuse warm nebula,
  respectively. To reproduce the Spitzer spectral energy distribution of PB 8, dust
  grains with a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.01 (by mass) were also included. It is found
  that the presence of metal-rich inclusions can explain the heavy element optical
  recombination lines, while a dual-dust chemistry with different grain species and
  discrete grain sizes likely produces the infrared continuum of this planetary nebula.
  This study demonstrates that the bi-abundance hypothesis, which was examined in
  a few planetary nebulae with large abundance discrepancies (ADFs $gt$ 10), could
  also be applied to those typical planetary nebulae with moderate abundance discrepancies.
