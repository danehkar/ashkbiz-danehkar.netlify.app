abstract: RT Cru belongs to the rare class of hard X-ray emitting symbiotics, whose
  origin is not yet fully understood. In this work, we have conducted a detailed spectroscopic
  analysis of X-ray emission from RT Cru based on observations taken by the Chandra
  Observatory using the Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) on the High-Resolution
  Camera Spectrometer (HRC-S) in 2015 and the High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG)
  on the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer S-array (ACIS-S) in 2005. Our thermal plasma
  modelling of the time-averaged HRC-S/LETG spectrum suggests a mean temperature of
  kT ~ 1.3 keV, whereas kT ~ 9.6 keV according to the time- averaged ACIS-S/HETG.
  The soft thermal plasma emission component (~1.3 keV) found in the HRC-S is heavily
  obscured by dense materials ($gt$5 Ã— 10$^23$ cm$^-2$). The aperiodic variability
  seen in its light curves could be due to changes in either absorbing material covering
  the hard X-ray source or intrinsic emission mechanism in the inner layers of the
  accretion disc. To understand the variability, we extracted the spectra in the 'low/hard'
  and 'high/soft' spectral states, which indicated higher plasma temperatures in the
  low/hard states of both the ACIS-S and HRC-S. The source also has a fluorescent
  iron emission line at 6.4 keV, likely emitted from reflection off an accretion disc
  or dense absorber, which was twice as bright in the HRC-S epoch compared to the
  ACIS-S. The soft thermal component identified in the HRC-S might be an indication
  of a jet that deserves further evaluations using high-resolution imaging observations.
