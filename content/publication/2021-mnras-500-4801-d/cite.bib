 abstract = {RT Cru belongs to the rare class of hard X-ray emitting symbiotics,
whose origin is not yet fully understood. In this work, we have
conducted a detailed spectroscopic analysis of X-ray emission
from RT Cru based on observations taken by the Chandra
Observatory using the Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) on
the High-Resolution Camera Spectrometer (HRC-S) in 2015 and the
High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) on the Advanced CCD
Imaging Spectrometer S-array (ACIS-S) in 2005. Our thermal
plasma modelling of the time-averaged HRC-S/LETG spectrum
suggests a mean temperature of kT ~ 1.3 keV,
whereas kT ~ 9.6 keV according to the time-
averaged ACIS-S/HETG. The soft thermal plasma emission component
(~1.3 keV) found in the HRC-S is heavily
obscured by dense materials ($\gt$5 Ã— 10$^23$
cm$^-2$). The aperiodic variability seen in its light curves
could be due to changes in either absorbing material covering
the hard X-ray source or intrinsic emission mechanism in the
inner layers of the accretion disc. To understand the
variability, we extracted the spectra in the 'low/hard' and
'high/soft' spectral states, which indicated higher plasma
temperatures in the low/hard states of both the ACIS-S and
HRC-S. The source also has a fluorescent iron emission line at
6.4 keV, likely emitted from reflection off an accretion disc or
dense absorber, which was twice as bright in the HRC-S epoch
compared to the ACIS-S. The soft thermal component identified in
the HRC-S might be an indication of a jet that deserves further
evaluations using high-resolution imaging observations.},
