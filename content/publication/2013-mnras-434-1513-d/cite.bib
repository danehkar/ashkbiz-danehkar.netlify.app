 abstract = {The planetary nebula SuWt 2 (PN G311.0+02.4) is an unusual object with a
prominent, inclined central emission ellipse and faint bipolar
extensions. It has two A-type stars in a proven binary system at
the centre. However, the radiation from these two central stars
is too soft to ionize the surrounding material leading to a so
far fruitless search for the responsible ionizing source. Such a
source is clearly required and has already been inferred to
exist via an observed temporal variation of the centre-of-mass
velocity of the A-type stars. Moreover, the ejected nebula is
nitrogen rich which raises question about the mass-loss process
from a likely intermediate-mass progenitor. We use optical
integral-field spectroscopy to study the emission lines of the
inner nebula ring. This has enabled us to perform an empirical
analysis of the optical collisionally excited lines, together
with a fully three-dimensional photoionization modelling. Our
empirical results are used to constrain the photoionization
models, which determine the evolutionary stage of the
responsible ionizing source and its likely progenitor. The time-
scale for the evolutionary track of a hydrogen-rich model
atmosphere is inconsistent with the dynamical age obtained for
the ring. This suggests that the central star has undergone a
very late thermal pulse. We conclude that the ionizing star
could be hydrogen deficient and compatible with what is known as
a PG 1159-type star. The evolutionary tracks for the very late
thermal pulse models imply a central star mass of
\ensuremath∼0.64 M$_☉$, which originated from an
\ensuremath∼3 M$_☉$ progenitor. The evolutionary time-
scales suggest that the central star left the asymptotic giant
branch about 25 000 yr ago, which is consistent with the
nebula's age.},
