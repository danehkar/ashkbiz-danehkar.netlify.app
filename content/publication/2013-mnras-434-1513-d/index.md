abstract: The planetary nebula SuWt 2 (PN G311.0+02.4) is an unusual object with a
  prominent, inclined central emission ellipse and faint bipolar extensions. It has
  two A-type stars in a proven binary system at the centre. However, the radiation
  from these two central stars is too soft to ionize the surrounding material leading
  to a so far fruitless search for the responsible ionizing source. Such a source
  is clearly required and has already been inferred to exist via an observed temporal
  variation of the centre-of-mass velocity of the A-type stars. Moreover, the ejected
  nebula is nitrogen rich which raises question about the mass-loss process from a
  likely intermediate-mass progenitor. We use optical integral-field spectroscopy
  to study the emission lines of the inner nebula ring. This has enabled us to perform
  an empirical analysis of the optical collisionally excited lines, together with
  a fully three-dimensional photoionization modelling. Our empirical results are used
  to constrain the photoionization models, which determine the evolutionary stage
  of the responsible ionizing source and its likely progenitor. The time- scale for
  the evolutionary track of a hydrogen-rich model atmosphere is inconsistent with
  the dynamical age obtained for the ring. This suggests that the central star has
  undergone a very late thermal pulse. We conclude that the ionizing star could be
  hydrogen deficient and compatible with what is known as a PG 1159-type star. The
  evolutionary tracks for the very late thermal pulse models imply a central star
  mass of ensuremath∼0.64 M$_☉$, which originated from an ensuremath∼3 M$_☉$ progenitor.
  The evolutionary time- scales suggest that the central star left the asymptotic
  giant branch about 25 000 yr ago, which is consistent with the nebula's age.
