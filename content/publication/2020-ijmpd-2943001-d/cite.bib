 abstract = {Local conformal symmetry introduces the conformal curvature (Weyl
tensor) that gets split into its (gravito-) electric and
magnetic (tensor) parts. Newtonian tidal forces are expected
from the gravitoelectric field, whereas general-relativistic
frame-dragging effects emerge from the gravitomagnetic field.
The symmetric, traceless gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic
tensor fields can be visualized by their eigenvectors and
eigenvalues. In this paper, we depict the gravitoelectric and
gravitomagnetic fields around a slowly rotating black hole. This
suggests that the phenomenon of ultra-fast outflows observed at
the centers of active galaxies may give evidence for the
gravitomagnetic fields of spinning supermassive black holes. We
also question whether the current issues in our contemporary
observations might be resolved by the inclusion of
gravitomagnetism on large scales in a perturbed FLRW model.},
