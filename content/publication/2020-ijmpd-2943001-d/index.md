abstract: Local conformal symmetry introduces the conformal curvature (Weyl tensor)
  that gets split into its (gravito-) electric and magnetic (tensor) parts. Newtonian
  tidal forces are expected from the gravitoelectric field, whereas general-relativistic
  frame-dragging effects emerge from the gravitomagnetic field. The symmetric, traceless
  gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic tensor fields can be visualized by their eigenvectors
  and eigenvalues. In this paper, we depict the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic
  fields around a slowly rotating black hole. This suggests that the phenomenon of
  ultra-fast outflows observed at the centers of active galaxies may give evidence
  for the gravitomagnetic fields of spinning supermassive black holes. We also question
  whether the current issues in our contemporary observations might be resolved by
  the inclusion of gravitomagnetism on large scales in a perturbed FLRW model.
