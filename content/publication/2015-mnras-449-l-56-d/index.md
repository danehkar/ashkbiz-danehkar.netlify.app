abstract: We have performed integral field spectroscopy of the planetary nebulae Hen
  3-1333 (PNG332.9-09.9) and Hen 2-113 (PNG321.0+03.9), which are unusual in exhibiting
  dual-dust chemistry and multipolar lobes but also ionized by late-type [WC 10] central
  stars. The spatially resolved velocity distributions of the Hensuremathα emission
  line were used to determine their primary orientations. The integrated Hensuremathα
  emission profiles indicate that Hen 3-1333 and Hen 2-113 expand with velocities
  of ~32 and 23 km s$^-1$, respectively. The Hubble Space Telescope observations suggest
  that these planetary nebulae have two pairs of tenuous lobes extending upwardly
  from their bright compact cores. From three-dimensional geometric models, the primary
  lobes of Hen 3-1333 and Hen 2-113 were found to have inclination angles of about
  -30° and 40° relative to the line of sight, and position angles of -15° and 65°
  measured east of north in the equatorial coordinate system, respectively.
