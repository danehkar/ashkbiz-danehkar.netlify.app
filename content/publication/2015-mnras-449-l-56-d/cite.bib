 abstract = {We have performed integral field spectroscopy of the planetary nebulae
Hen 3-1333 (PNG332.9-09.9) and Hen 2-113 (PNG321.0+03.9), which
are unusual in exhibiting dual-dust chemistry and multipolar
lobes but also ionized by late-type [WC 10] central stars. The
spatially resolved velocity distributions of the
H\ensuremathα emission line were used to determine
their primary orientations. The integrated
H\ensuremathα emission profiles indicate that Hen
3-1333 and Hen 2-113 expand with velocities of
~32 and 23 km s$^-1$, respectively. The Hubble
Space Telescope observations suggest that these planetary
nebulae have two pairs of tenuous lobes extending upwardly from
their bright compact cores. From three-dimensional geometric
models, the primary lobes of Hen 3-1333 and Hen 2-113 were found
to have inclination angles of about -30° and
40° relative to the line of sight, and position
angles of -15° and 65° measured east of
north in the equatorial coordinate system, respectively.},
