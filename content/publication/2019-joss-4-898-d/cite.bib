 abstract = {Spectra emitted from ionized nebulae typically contain collisionally
excited and recombination lines, which can be used to trace
physical conditions and chemical abundances of the interstellar
medium in our Galaxy and other galaxies. ``AtomNeb'' is a
database containing atomic data stored in the Flexible Image
Transport System (FITS) file format, including the data for
collisionally excited and recombination lines generally observed
in nebular astrophysics. The AtomNeb interface library is
equipped with several application programming interface (API)
functions developed in the Interactive Data Language (IDL),
which can be also used in the GNU Data Language (GDL). This IDL
library relies on the FITS file related IDL procedures from the
IDL Astronomy User's library. The AtomNeb IDL library, together
with the ``proEQUIB'' IDL library, can be used to perform plasma
diagnostics and abundance analysis of emission lines from
ionized gaseous nebulae.},
