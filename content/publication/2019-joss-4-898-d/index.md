abstract: Spectra emitted from ionized nebulae typically contain collisionally excited
  and recombination lines, which can be used to trace physical conditions and chemical
  abundances of the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and other galaxies. ``AtomNeb''
  is a database containing atomic data stored in the Flexible Image Transport System
  (FITS) file format, including the data for collisionally excited and recombination
  lines generally observed in nebular astrophysics. The AtomNeb interface library
  is equipped with several application programming interface (API) functions developed
  in the Interactive Data Language (IDL), which can be also used in the GNU Data Language
  (GDL). This IDL library relies on the FITS file related IDL procedures from the
  IDL Astronomy User's library. The AtomNeb IDL library, together with the ``proEQUIB''
  IDL library, can be used to perform plasma diagnostics and abundance analysis of
  emission lines from ionized gaseous nebulae.
