 abstract = {Integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy of planetary nebulae (PNe)
provides a plethora of information about their morphologies and
ionization structures. An IFU survey of a sample of PNe around
hydrogen-deficient stars has been conducted with the Wide Field
Spectrograph (WiFeS) on the ANU 2.3-m telescope. In this paper,
we present the H\ensuremathα kinematic observations of
the PN M 2-42 with a weak emission-line star (wels), and the
compact PNe Hen 3-1333 and Hen 2-113 around Wolf-Rayet ([WR])
stars from this WiFeS survey. We see that the ring and point-
symmetric knots previously identified in the velocity [N ii]
channels of M 2-42 are also surrounded by a thin exterior
ionized H\ensuremathα halo, whose polar expansion is
apparently faster than the low-ionization knots. The velocity-
resolved H\ensuremathα channel maps of Hen 3-1333 and
Hen 2-113 also suggest that the faint multipolar lobes may get
to a projected outflow velocity of \ensuremath∼100
\ensuremath± 20 km s\ensuremath-1 far from the central
stars. Our recent kinematic studies of the WiFeS/IFU survey of
other PNe around [WR] and wels mostly hint at elliptical
morphologies, while collimated outflows are present in many of
them. As the WiFeS does not have adequate resolution for compact
(\ensuremathłeq6 arcsec) PNe, future high-resolution
spatially-resolved observations are necessary to unveil full
details of their morpho-kinematic structures.},
