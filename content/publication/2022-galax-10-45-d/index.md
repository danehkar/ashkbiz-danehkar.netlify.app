abstract: Integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy of planetary nebulae (PNe) provides
  a plethora of information about their morphologies and ionization structures. An
  IFU survey of a sample of PNe around hydrogen-deficient stars has been conducted
  with the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) on the ANU 2.3-m telescope. In this paper,
  we present the Hensuremathα kinematic observations of the PN M 2-42 with a weak
  emission-line star (wels), and the compact PNe Hen 3-1333 and Hen 2-113 around Wolf-Rayet
  ([WR]) stars from this WiFeS survey. We see that the ring and point- symmetric knots
  previously identified in the velocity [N ii] channels of M 2-42 are also surrounded
  by a thin exterior ionized Hensuremathα halo, whose polar expansion is apparently
  faster than the low-ionization knots. The velocity- resolved Hensuremathα channel
  maps of Hen 3-1333 and Hen 2-113 also suggest that the faint multipolar lobes may
  get to a projected outflow velocity of ensuremath∼100 ensuremath± 20 km sensuremath-1
  far from the central stars. Our recent kinematic studies of the WiFeS/IFU survey
  of other PNe around [WR] and wels mostly hint at elliptical morphologies, while
  collimated outflows are present in many of them. As the WiFeS does not have adequate
  resolution for compact (ensuremathłeq6 arcsec) PNe, future high-resolution spatially-resolved
  observations are necessary to unveil full details of their morpho-kinematic structures.
