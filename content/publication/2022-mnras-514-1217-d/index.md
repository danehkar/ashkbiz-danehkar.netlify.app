abstract: 'The planetary nebula (PN) IC 4997 is one of a few rapidly evolving objects
  with variable brightness and nebular emission around a hydrogen-deficient star.
  In this study, we have determined the physical conditions and chemical abundances
  of this object using the collisionally excited lines (CELs) and optical recombination
  lines (ORLs) measured from the medium-resolution spectra taken in 2014 July with
  the FIbre-fed Échelle Spectrograph on the Nordic Optical Telescope at La Palma Observatory.
  We derived electron densities of ensuremathgtrsim 3 × 10$^4$ cm$^-3$ and electron
  temperatures of ensuremathgtrsim 14 000 K from CELs, whereas cooler temperatures
  of åisebox-0.5ex~11 000 and i̊sebox-0.5ex~7000 K were obtained from helium and heavy
  element ORLs, respectively. The elemental abundances deduced from CELs point to
  a metal-poor progenitor with [O/H] ensuremathłesssim -0.75, whereas the ORL abundances
  are slightly above the solar metallicity, [O/H] ≍ 0.15. Our abundance analysis indicates
  that the abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs ensuremath≡ ORLs/CELs) of this PN are
  relatively large: ADF(O$^2+$) ensuremathgtrsim 8 and ADF(N$^2+$) ensuremathgtrsim
  7. Further research is needed to find out how the ADFs and variable emissions are
  formed in this object and whether they are associated with a binary companion or
  a very late thermal pulse.'
