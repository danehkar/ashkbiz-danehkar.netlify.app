 abstract = {The planetary nebula (PN) IC 4997 is one of a few rapidly evolving
objects with variable brightness and nebular emission around a
hydrogen-deficient star. In this study, we have determined the
physical conditions and chemical abundances of this object using
the collisionally excited lines (CELs) and optical recombination
lines (ORLs) measured from the medium-resolution spectra taken
in 2014 July with the FIbre-fed Échelle Spectrograph on the
Nordic Optical Telescope at La Palma Observatory. We derived
electron densities of \ensuremath\gtrsim 3 ×
10$^4$ cm$^-3$ and electron temperatures of
\ensuremath\gtrsim 14 000 K from CELs, whereas cooler
temperatures of åisebox-0.5ex~11 000 and
\i̊sebox-0.5ex~7000 K were obtained from helium
and heavy element ORLs, respectively. The elemental abundances
deduced from CELs point to a metal-poor progenitor with [O/H]
\ensuremathłesssim -0.75, whereas the ORL abundances are
slightly above the solar metallicity, [O/H] ≍ 0.15. Our
abundance analysis indicates that the abundance discrepancy
factors (ADFs \ensuremath≡ ORLs/CELs) of this PN are
relatively large: ADF(O$^2+$) \ensuremath\gtrsim 8 and
ADF(N$^2+$) \ensuremath\gtrsim 7. Further research is
needed to find out how the ADFs and variable emissions are
formed in this object and whether they are associated with a
binary companion or a very late thermal pulse.},
