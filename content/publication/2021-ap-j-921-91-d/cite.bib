 abstract = {Superwinds and superbubbles driven by mechanical feedback from super
star clusters (SSCs) are common features in many star-forming
galaxies. While the adiabatic fluid model can well describe the
dynamics of superwinds, several observations of starburst
galaxies revealed the presence of compact regions with
suppressed superwinds and strongly radiative cooling, i.e.,
catastrophic cooling. In the present study, we employ the
nonequilibrium atomic chemistry and cooling package MAIHEM,
built on the FLASH hydrodynamics code, to generate a grid of
models investigating the dependence of cooling modes on the
metallicity, SSC outflow parameters, and ambient density. While
gas metallicity plays a substantial role, catastrophic cooling
is more sensitive to high mass loading and reduced kinetic
heating efficiency. Our hydrodynamic simulations indicate that
the presence of a hot superbubble does not necessarily imply an
adiabatic outflow and vice versa. Using CLOUDY photoionization
models, we predict UV and optical line emission for both
adiabatic and catastrophic cooling outflows, for radiation-
bounded and partially density-bounded models. Although the line
ratios predicted by our radiation-bounded models agree well with
observations of star-forming galaxies, they do not provide
diagnostics that unambiguously distinguish the parameter space
of catastrophically cooling flows. Comparison with observations
suggests the possibility of minor density bounding,
nonequilibrium ionization, and/or observational bias toward the
central outflow regions.},
