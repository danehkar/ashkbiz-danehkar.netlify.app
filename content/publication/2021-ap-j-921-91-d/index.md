abstract: Superwinds and superbubbles driven by mechanical feedback from super star
  clusters (SSCs) are common features in many star-forming galaxies. While the adiabatic
  fluid model can well describe the dynamics of superwinds, several observations of
  starburst galaxies revealed the presence of compact regions with suppressed superwinds
  and strongly radiative cooling, i.e., catastrophic cooling. In the present study,
  we employ the nonequilibrium atomic chemistry and cooling package MAIHEM, built
  on the FLASH hydrodynamics code, to generate a grid of models investigating the
  dependence of cooling modes on the metallicity, SSC outflow parameters, and ambient
  density. While gas metallicity plays a substantial role, catastrophic cooling is
  more sensitive to high mass loading and reduced kinetic heating efficiency. Our
  hydrodynamic simulations indicate that the presence of a hot superbubble does not
  necessarily imply an adiabatic outflow and vice versa. Using CLOUDY photoionization
  models, we predict UV and optical line emission for both adiabatic and catastrophic
  cooling outflows, for radiation- bounded and partially density-bounded models. Although
  the line ratios predicted by our radiation-bounded models agree well with observations
  of star-forming galaxies, they do not provide diagnostics that unambiguously distinguish
  the parameter space of catastrophically cooling flows. Comparison with observations
  suggests the possibility of minor density bounding, nonequilibrium ionization, and/or
  observational bias toward the central outflow regions.
