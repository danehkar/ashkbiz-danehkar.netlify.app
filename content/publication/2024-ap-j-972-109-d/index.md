abstract: Hard X-ray-emitting (ensuremathδ-type) symbiotic binaries, which exhibit
  a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge to our understanding of accretion
  physics in degenerate dwarfs. RT Cru, which is a member of the ensuremathδ-type
  symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses of X-ray observations
  from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations,
  in addition to a spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen with
  Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray variability, we analyze the multimission
  X-ray data using principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the spectral
  components that contribute most to the flickering behavior and the hardness transition.
  The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components,
  which may contain some variable emission features, especially in the soft excess.
  Additionally, the absorbing column (first order with 50%), along with the source
  continuum (20%), and a third component (9%)—which likely accounts for thermal emission
  in the soft band—are the three principal components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations.
  The PCA components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum and possibly
  emission features. Our findings suggest that the spectral hardness transition between
  the two Suzaku observations is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and
  X-ray continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may result in
  flickering-type variations.
