 abstract = {Hard X-ray-emitting (\ensuremathδ-type) symbiotic binaries,
which exhibit a strong hard X-ray excess, have posed a challenge
to our understanding of accretion physics in degenerate dwarfs.
RT Cru, which is a member of the \ensuremathδ-type
symbiotics, shows stochastic X-ray variability. Timing analyses
of X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, which we
consider here, indicate hourly fluctuations, in addition to a
spectral transition from 2007 to a harder state in 2012 seen
with Suzaku observations. To trace the nature of X-ray
variability, we analyze the multimission X-ray data using
principal component analysis (PCA), which determines the
spectral components that contribute most to the flickering
behavior and the hardness transition. The Chandra HRC-S/LETG and
XMM-Newton EPIC-pn data provide the primary PCA components,
which may contain some variable emission features, especially in
the soft excess. Additionally, the absorbing column (first order
with 50%), along with the source continuum (20%), and a third
component (9%)—which likely accounts for thermal
emission in the soft band—are the three principal
components found in the Suzaku XIS1 observations. The PCA
components of the NuSTAR data also correspond to the continuum
and possibly emission features. Our findings suggest that the
spectral hardness transition between the two Suzaku observations
is mainly due to changes in the absorbing material and X-ray
continuum, while some changes in the thermal plasma emission may
result in flickering-type variations.},
