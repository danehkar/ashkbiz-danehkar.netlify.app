abstract: We present a detailed X-ray spectral study of the quasar PG 1211+143 based
  on Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) observations collected
  in a multi-wavelength campaign with UV data using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic
  Origins Spectrograph (HST-COS) and radio bands using the Jansky Very Large Array
  (VLA). We constructed a multi-wavelength ionizing spectral energy distribution using
  these observations and archival infrared data to create XSTAR photoionization models
  specific to the PG 1211+143 flux behavior during the epoch of our observations.
  Our analysis of the Chandra-HETGS spectra yields complex absorption lines from H-like
  and He-like ions of Ne, Mg, and Si, which confirm the presence of an ultra-fast
  outflow (UFO) with a velocity of approximately -17,300 km s$^-1$ (outflow redshift
  z $_out$ ~ -0.0561) in the rest frame of PG 1211+143. This absorber is well described
  by an ionization parameter logensuremathξ ~ 2.9 erg s$^-1$ m̧ and column density
  logN$_H$~ 21.5 ̧$^-2$. This corresponds to a stable region of the absorbertextquoterights
  thermal stability curve, and furthermore its implied neutral hydrogen column is
  broadly consistent with a broad Lyensuremathα absorption line at a mean outflow
  velocity of approximately -16,980 km s$^-1$ detected by our HST-COS observations.
  Our findings represent the first simultaneous detection of a UFO in both X-ray and
  UV observations. Our VLA observations provide evidence for an active jet in PG 1211+143,
  which may be connected to the X-ray and UV outflows; this possibility can be evaluated
  using very- long-baseline interferometric observations.
