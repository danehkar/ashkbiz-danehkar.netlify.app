 abstract = {We present a detailed X-ray spectral study of the quasar PG 1211+143
based on Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer
(HETGS) observations collected in a multi-wavelength campaign
with UV data using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins
Spectrograph (HST-COS) and radio bands using the Jansky Very
Large Array (VLA). We constructed a multi-wavelength ionizing
spectral energy distribution using these observations and
archival infrared data to create XSTAR photoionization models
specific to the PG 1211+143 flux behavior during the epoch of
our observations. Our analysis of the Chandra-HETGS spectra
yields complex absorption lines from H-like and He-like ions of
Ne, Mg, and Si, which confirm the presence of an ultra-fast
outflow (UFO) with a velocity of approximately -17,300 km
s$^-1$ (outflow redshift z $_out$ ~ -0.0561)
in the rest frame of PG 1211+143. This absorber is well
described by an ionization parameter \log\\ensuremathξ
~ 2.9 \erg\ \\\s\\\$^-1$ m̧\ and
column density \log\\N\$_\\H$\\~ 21.5
\\\̧\$^-2$. This corresponds to a stable region of the
absorber\textquoterights thermal stability curve, and
furthermore its implied neutral hydrogen column is broadly
consistent with a broad Ly\ensuremathα absorption line
at a mean outflow velocity of approximately -16,980 km s$^-1$
detected by our HST-COS observations. Our findings represent the
first simultaneous detection of a UFO in both X-ray and UV
observations. Our VLA observations provide evidence for an
active jet in PG 1211+143, which may be connected to the X-ray
and UV outflows; this possibility can be evaluated using very-
long-baseline interferometric observations.},
