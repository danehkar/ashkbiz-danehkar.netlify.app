abstract: We use the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys to obtain
  the first spatially resolved, nebular imaging in the light of C IV ensuremathłambda
  ensuremathłambda1548, 1551 by using the F150LP and F165LP filters. These observations
  of the local starburst Mrk 71 in NGC 2366 show emission apparently originating within
  the interior cavity around the dominant super star cluster (SSC), Knot A. Together
  with imaging in He II ensuremathłambda4686 and supporting Space Telescope Imaging
  Spectrograph far-ultraviolet spectroscopy, the morphology and intensity of the C
  IV nebular surface brightness and the C IV/He II ratio map provide direct evidence
  that the mechanical feedback is likely dominated by catastrophic radiative cooling,
  which strongly disrupts adiabatic superbubble evolution. The implied extreme mass
  loading and low kinetic efficiency of the cluster wind are reasonably consistent
  with the wind energy budget, which is probably enhanced by radiation pressure. In
  contrast, the Knot B SSC lies within a well-defined superbubble with associated
  soft X-rays and He II ensuremathłambda1640 emission, which are signatures of adiabatic,
  energy-driven feedback from a supernova-driven outflow. This system lacks clear
  evidence of C IV from the limb- brightened shell, as expected for this model, but
  the observations may not be deep enough to confirm its presence. We also detect
  a small C IV-emitting object that is likely an embedded compact H II region. Its
  C IV emission may indicate the presence of very massive stars (>100 M $_ensuremathødot$)
  or strongly pressure-confined stellar feedback.
