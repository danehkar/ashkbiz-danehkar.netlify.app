 abstract = {We use the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys to obtain
the first spatially resolved, nebular imaging in the light of C
IV \ensuremathłambda \ensuremathłambda1548, 1551 by
using the F150LP and F165LP filters. These observations of the
local starburst Mrk 71 in NGC 2366 show emission apparently
originating within the interior cavity around the dominant super
star cluster (SSC), Knot A. Together with imaging in He II
\ensuremathłambda4686 and supporting Space Telescope
Imaging Spectrograph far-ultraviolet spectroscopy, the
morphology and intensity of the C IV nebular surface brightness
and the C IV/He II ratio map provide direct evidence that the
mechanical feedback is likely dominated by catastrophic
radiative cooling, which strongly disrupts adiabatic superbubble
evolution. The implied extreme mass loading and low kinetic
efficiency of the cluster wind are reasonably consistent with
the wind energy budget, which is probably enhanced by radiation
pressure. In contrast, the Knot B SSC lies within a well-defined
superbubble with associated soft X-rays and He II
\ensuremathłambda1640 emission, which are signatures of
adiabatic, energy-driven feedback from a supernova-driven
outflow. This system lacks clear evidence of C IV from the limb-
brightened shell, as expected for this model, but the
observations may not be deep enough to confirm its presence. We
also detect a small C IV-emitting object that is likely an
embedded compact H II region. Its C IV emission may indicate the
presence of very massive stars (>100 M
$_\ensuremathødot$) or strongly pressure-confined stellar
feedback.},
