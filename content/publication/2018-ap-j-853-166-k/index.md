abstract: We observed the quasar PG 1211+143 using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
  on the Hubble Space Telescope in 2015 April as part of a joint campaign with the
  Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Jansky Very Large Array. Our ultraviolet spectra
  cover the wavelength range 912-2100 ̊A. We find a broad absorption feature (~ 1080
  km s$^-1$) at an observed wavelength of 1240 Å. Interpreting this as H I Lyensuremathα,
  in the rest frame of PG 1211+143 (z = 0.0809), this corresponds to an outflow velocity
  of -16,980 km s$^-1$ (outflow redshift z$_out$~ -0.0551), matching the moderate
  ionization X-ray absorption system detected in our Chandra observation and reported
  previously by Pounds et al. With a minimum H I column density of log N$_H$I$gt$
  14.5, and no absorption in other UV resonance lines, this Lyensuremathα absorber
  is consistent with arising in the same ultrafast outflow as the X-ray absorbing
  gas. The Lyensuremathα feature is weak or absent in archival ultraviolet spectra
  of PG 1211+143, strongly suggesting that this absorption is transient, and intrinsic
  to PG 1211+143. Such a simultaneous detection in two independent wavebands for the
  first time gives strong confirmation of the reality of an ultrafast outflow in an
  active galactic nucleus.
