 abstract = {We observed the quasar PG 1211+143 using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph
on the Hubble Space Telescope in 2015 April as part of a joint
campaign with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Jansky Very
Large Array. Our ultraviolet spectra cover the wavelength range
912-2100 ̊A. We find a broad absorption feature
(~ 1080 \km\ \\\s\\\$^-1$) at an
observed wavelength of 1240 \Å. Interpreting this as H I
Ly\ensuremathα, in the rest frame of PG 1211+143 (z =
0.0809), this corresponds to an outflow velocity of -16,980
\km\ \\\s\\\$^-1$ (outflow redshift
\z\$_\out$\~ -0.0551), matching the
moderate ionization X-ray absorption system detected in our
Chandra observation and reported previously by Pounds et al.
With a minimum H I column density of \log\
\N\$_\\H$\\\I\\\$\gt$ 14.5, and no absorption in
other UV resonance lines, this Ly\ensuremathα absorber
is consistent with arising in the same ultrafast outflow as the
X-ray absorbing gas. The Ly\ensuremathα feature is weak
or absent in archival ultraviolet spectra of PG 1211+143,
strongly suggesting that this absorption is transient, and
intrinsic to PG 1211+143. Such a simultaneous detection in two
independent wavebands for the first time gives strong
confirmation of the reality of an ultrafast outflow in an active
galactic nucleus.},
