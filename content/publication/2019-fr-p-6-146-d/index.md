abstract: Over the past two decades, electric-magnetic duality has made significant
  progress in linearized gravity and higher spin gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions.
  By analogy with Maxwell theory, the Dirac quantization condition has been generalized
  to both the conserved electric-type and magnetic-type sources associated with gravitational
  fields and higher spin fields. The linearized Einstein equations in D dimensions,
  which are expressed in terms of the Pauli-Fierz field of the textitgraviton described
  by a 2nd-rank symmetric tensor, can be dual to the linearized field equations of
  the textitdual graviton described by a Young symmetry (D-3, 1) tensor. Hence, the
  dual formulations of linearized gravity are written by a 2nd-rank symmetric tensor
  describing the Pauli-Fierz field of the dual graviton in D=4, while we have the
  Curtright field with Young symmetry type (2,1) in D=5. The equations of motion of
  spin-s fields (s$gt$2) described by the generalized Fronsdal action can also be
  dualized to the equations of motion of dual spin-s fields. In this review, we focus
  on dual formulations of gravity and higher spin fields in the linearized theory,
  and study their SO(2) electric-magnetic duality invariance, twisted self-duality
  conditions, harmonic conditions for wave solutions, and their configurations with
  electric-type and magnetic-type sources. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the latest
  developments in their interacting theories.
