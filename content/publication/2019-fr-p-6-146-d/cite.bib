 abstract = {Over the past two decades, electric-magnetic duality has made
significant progress in linearized gravity and higher spin gauge
fields in arbitrary dimensions. By analogy with Maxwell theory,
the Dirac quantization condition has been generalized to both
the conserved electric-type and magnetic-type sources associated
with gravitational fields and higher spin fields. The linearized
Einstein equations in D dimensions, which are expressed in terms
of the Pauli-Fierz field of the \textit\graviton\
described by a 2nd-rank symmetric tensor, can be dual to the
linearized field equations of the \textit\dual
graviton\ described by a Young symmetry (D-3, 1) tensor. Hence,
the dual formulations of linearized gravity are written by a
2nd-rank symmetric tensor describing the Pauli-Fierz field of
the dual graviton in D=4, while we have the Curtright field with
Young symmetry type (2,1) in D=5. The equations of motion of
spin-s fields (s>2) described by the generalized Fronsdal action
can also be dualized to the equations of motion of dual spin-s
fields. In this review, we focus on dual formulations of gravity
and higher spin fields in the linearized theory, and study their
SO(2) electric-magnetic duality invariance, twisted self-duality
conditions, harmonic conditions for wave solutions, and their
configurations with electric-type and magnetic-type sources.
Furthermore, we briefly discuss the latest developments in their
interacting theories.},
