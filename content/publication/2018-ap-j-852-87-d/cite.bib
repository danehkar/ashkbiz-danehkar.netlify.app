 abstract = {The planetary nebula (PN) NGC 5189 around a Wolf-Rayet [WO] central star
demonstrates one of the most remarkable complex morphologies
among PNe with many multiscale structures, showing evidence of
multiple outbursts from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
progenitor. In this study, we use multiwavelength Hubble Space
Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 observations to study the
morphology of the inner 0.3 pc × 0.2 pc region
surrounding the central binary that appears to be a relic of a
more recent outburst of the progenitor AGB star. We applied
diagnostic diagrams based on emission-line ratios of
H\ensuremathα \ensuremathłambda6563, [O III]
\ensuremathłambda5007, and [S II] \ensuremathłambda
\ensuremathłambda 6716,6731 images to identify the location
and morphology of low-ionization structures within the inner
nebula. We distinguished two inner, low-ionization envelopes
from the ionized gas, within a radius of 55 arcsec
(~0.15 pc) extending from the central star: a
large envelope expanding toward the northeast, and its smaller
counterpart envelope in the opposite direction toward the
southwest of the nebula. These low-ionization envelopes are
surrounded by a highly ionized gaseous environment. We believe
that these low-ionization expanding envelopes are a result of a
powerful outburst from the post-AGB star that created shocked
wind regions as they propagate through the previously expelled
material along a symmetric axis. Our diagnostic mapping using
high-angular resolution line-emission imaging can provide a
novel approach to detection of low-ionization regions in other
PNe, especially those showing a complex multiscale morphology.},
