abstract: 'The planetary nebula (PN) NGC 5189 around a Wolf-Rayet [WO] central star
  demonstrates one of the most remarkable complex morphologies among PNe with many
  multiscale structures, showing evidence of multiple outbursts from an asymptotic
  giant branch (AGB) progenitor. In this study, we use multiwavelength Hubble Space
  Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 observations to study the morphology of the inner
  0.3 pc × 0.2 pc region surrounding the central binary that appears to be a relic
  of a more recent outburst of the progenitor AGB star. We applied diagnostic diagrams
  based on emission-line ratios of Hensuremathα ensuremathłambda6563, [O III] ensuremathłambda5007,
  and [S II] ensuremathłambda ensuremathłambda 6716,6731 images to identify the location
  and morphology of low-ionization structures within the inner nebula. We distinguished
  two inner, low-ionization envelopes from the ionized gas, within a radius of 55
  arcsec (~0.15 pc) extending from the central star: a large envelope expanding toward
  the northeast, and its smaller counterpart envelope in the opposite direction toward
  the southwest of the nebula. These low-ionization envelopes are surrounded by a
  highly ionized gaseous environment. We believe that these low-ionization expanding
  envelopes are a result of a powerful outburst from the post-AGB star that created
  shocked wind regions as they propagate through the previously expelled material
  along a symmetric axis. Our diagnostic mapping using high-angular resolution line-emission
  imaging can provide a novel approach to detection of low-ionization regions in other
  PNe, especially those showing a complex multiscale morphology.'
