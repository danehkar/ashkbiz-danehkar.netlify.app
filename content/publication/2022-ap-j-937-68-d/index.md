abstract: Observations of some starburst-driven galactic superwinds suggest that strong
  radiative cooling could play a key role in the nature of feedback and the formation
  of stars and molecular gas in star- forming galaxies. These catastrophically cooling
  superwinds are not adequately described by adiabatic fluid models, but they can
  be reproduced by incorporating nonequilibrium radiative cooling functions into the
  fluid model. In this work, we have employed the atomic and cooling module MAIHEM
  implemented in the framework of the FLASH hydrodynamics code to simulate the formation
  of radiatively cooling superwinds as well as their corresponding nonequilibrium
  ionization (NEI) states for various outflow parameters, gas metallicities, and ambient
  densities. We employ the photoionization program CLOUDY to predict radiation- and
  density-bounded photoionization for these radiatively cooling superwinds, and we
  predict UV and optical line emission. Our nonequilibrium photoionization models
  built with the NEI states demonstrate the enhancement of C IV, especially in metal-
  rich, catastrophically cooling outflows, and O VI in metal-poor ones.
