 abstract = {Observations of some starburst-driven galactic superwinds suggest that
strong radiative cooling could play a key role in the nature of
feedback and the formation of stars and molecular gas in star-
forming galaxies. These catastrophically cooling superwinds are
not adequately described by adiabatic fluid models, but they can
be reproduced by incorporating nonequilibrium radiative cooling
functions into the fluid model. In this work, we have employed
the atomic and cooling module MAIHEM implemented in the
framework of the FLASH hydrodynamics code to simulate the
formation of radiatively cooling superwinds as well as their
corresponding nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) states for various
outflow parameters, gas metallicities, and ambient densities. We
employ the photoionization program CLOUDY to predict radiation-
and density-bounded photoionization for these radiatively
cooling superwinds, and we predict UV and optical line emission.
Our nonequilibrium photoionization models built with the NEI
states demonstrate the enhancement of C IV, especially in metal-
rich, catastrophically cooling outflows, and O VI in metal-poor
ones.},
