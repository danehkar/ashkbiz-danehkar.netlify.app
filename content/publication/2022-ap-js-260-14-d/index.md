abstract: The majority of planetary nebulae (PNs) show axisymmetric morphologies,
  whose causes are not well understood. In this work, we present spatially resolved
  kinematic observations of 14 Galactic PNs surrounding Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) and weak
  emission-line stars (wels), based on the Hensuremathα and [N II] emission taken
  with the Wide Field Spectrograph on the Australian National University 2.3 m telescope.
  Velocity-resolved channel maps and position-velocity diagrams, together with archival
  Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based images, are employed to construct
  three-dimensional morpho-kinematic models of 12 objects using the program SHAPE.
  Our results indicate that these 12 PNs mostly have elliptical morphologies, with
  either open or closed outer ends. The kinematic maps show the on-sky orientations
  of the interior shells in NGC 6578 and NGC 6629, as well as the compact (ensuremathłeq6″)
  PNs Pe 1-1, M 3-15, M 1-25, Hen 2-142, and NGC 6567, in agreement with the elliptically
  symmetric morphologies seen in high-resolution HST images. Point-symmetric knots
  in Hb 4 exhibit deceleration with distance from the central star, which could be
  due to shock collisions with the ambient medium. The velocity dispersion maps of
  Pe 1-1 also disclose the shock interaction between its collimated outflows and the
  interstellar medium. Collimated bipolar outflows are also visible in the position-velocity
  diagrams of M 3-30, M 1-32, and M 3-15, which are reconstructed by tenuous prolate
  ellipsoids extending upward from dense equatorial regions in the kinematic models.
  The formation of aspherical morphologies and collimated outflows in these PNs could
  be related to the stellar evolution of hydrogen-deficient [WR] and wels nuclei,
  which require further investigation.
