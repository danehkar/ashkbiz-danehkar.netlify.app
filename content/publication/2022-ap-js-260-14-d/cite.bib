 abstract = {The majority of planetary nebulae (PNs) show axisymmetric morphologies,
whose causes are not well understood. In this work, we present
spatially resolved kinematic observations of 14 Galactic PNs
surrounding Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) and weak emission-line stars
(wels), based on the H\ensuremathα and [N II] emission
taken with the Wide Field Spectrograph on the Australian
National University 2.3 m telescope. Velocity-resolved channel
maps and position-velocity diagrams, together with archival
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based images, are
employed to construct three-dimensional morpho-kinematic models
of 12 objects using the program SHAPE. Our results indicate that
these 12 PNs mostly have elliptical morphologies, with either
open or closed outer ends. The kinematic maps show the on-sky
orientations of the interior shells in NGC 6578 and NGC 6629, as
well as the compact (\ensuremathłeq6″) PNs Pe 1-1, M 3-15,
M 1-25, Hen 2-142, and NGC 6567, in agreement with the
elliptically symmetric morphologies seen in high-resolution HST
images. Point-symmetric knots in Hb 4 exhibit deceleration with
distance from the central star, which could be due to shock
collisions with the ambient medium. The velocity dispersion maps
of Pe 1-1 also disclose the shock interaction between its
collimated outflows and the interstellar medium. Collimated
bipolar outflows are also visible in the position-velocity
diagrams of M 3-30, M 1-32, and M 3-15, which are reconstructed
by tenuous prolate ellipsoids extending upward from dense
equatorial regions in the kinematic models. The formation of
aspherical morphologies and collimated outflows in these PNs
could be related to the stellar evolution of hydrogen-deficient
[WR] and wels nuclei, which require further investigation.},
