 abstract = {We present a comprehensive set of spatially resolved, integral field
spectroscopic mapping of the Wolf-Rayet planetary nebula Th 2-A,
obtained using the Wide Field Spectrograph on the Australian
National University 2.3-m telescope. Velocity-resolved
H\ensuremathα channel maps with a resolution of 20 km
s$^-1$ allow us to identify different kinematic components
within the nebula. This information is used to develop a three-
dimensional morpho-kinematic model of the nebula using the
interactive kinematic modeling tool shape. These results suggest
that Th 2-A has a thick toroidal shell with an expansion
velocity of 40 \ensuremath± 10 km s$^-1$, and a thin
prolate ellipsoid with collimated bipolar outflows toward its
axis reaching velocities in the range of 70-110 km s$^-1$,
with respect to the central star. The relationship between its
morpho-kinematic structure and peculiar [WO]-type stellar
characteristics deserves further investigation.},
