abstract: We present a comprehensive set of spatially resolved, integral field spectroscopic
  mapping of the Wolf-Rayet planetary nebula Th 2-A, obtained using the Wide Field
  Spectrograph on the Australian National University 2.3-m telescope. Velocity-resolved
  Hensuremathα channel maps with a resolution of 20 km s$^-1$ allow us to identify
  different kinematic components within the nebula. This information is used to develop
  a three- dimensional morpho-kinematic model of the nebula using the interactive
  kinematic modeling tool shape. These results suggest that Th 2-A has a thick toroidal
  shell with an expansion velocity of 40 ensuremath± 10 km s$^-1$, and a thin prolate
  ellipsoid with collimated bipolar outflows toward its axis reaching velocities in
  the range of 70-110 km s$^-1$, with respect to the central star. The relationship
  between its morpho-kinematic structure and peculiar [WO]-type stellar characteristics
  deserves further investigation.
