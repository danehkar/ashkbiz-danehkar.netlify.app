abstract: We have conducted a detailed multi-wavelength study of the peculiar nebula
  Abell 48 and its central star. We classify the nucleus as a helium-rich, hydrogen-deficient
  star of type [WN4-5]. The evidence for either a massive WN or a low-mass [WN] interpretation
  is critically examined, and we firmly conclude that Abell 48 is a planetary nebula
  (PN) around an evolved low- mass star, rather than a Population I ejecta nebula.
  Importantly, the surrounding nebula has a morphology typical of PNe, and is not
  enriched in nitrogen, and thus not the `peeled atmosphere' of a massive star. We
  estimate a distance of 1.6 kpc and a reddening, E(B - V) = 1.90 mag, the latter
  value clearly showing the nebula lies on the near side of the Galactic bar, and
  cannot be a massive WN star. The ionized mass (~0.3 M$_ensuremathødot$) and electron
  density (700 cm$^-3$) are typical of middle-aged PNe. The observed stellar spectrum
  was compared to a grid of models from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) grid. The best-fitting
  temperature is 71 kK, and the atmospheric composition is dominated by helium with
  an upper limit on the hydrogen abundance of 10 per cent. Our results are in very
  good agreement with the recent study of Todt et al., who determined a hydrogen fraction
  of 10 per cent and an unusually large nitrogen fraction of ~5 per cent. This fraction
  is higher than any other low-mass H-deficient star, and is not readily explained
  by current post- AGB models. We give a discussion of the implications of this discovery
  for the late-stage evolution of intermediate-mass stars. There is now tentative
  evidence for two distinct helium- dominated post-AGB lineages, separate to the helium-
  and carbon- dominated surface compositions produced by a late thermal pulse. Further
  theoretical work is needed to explain these recent discoveries.
