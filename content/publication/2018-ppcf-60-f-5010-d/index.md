abstract: Suprathermal electrons and inertial drifting electrons, so called electron
  beam, are crucial to the nonlinear dynamics of electrostatic solitary waves observed
  in several astrophysical plasmas. In this paper, the propagation of electron-acoustic
  solitary waves (EAWs) is investigated in a collisionless, unmagnetized plasma consisting
  of cool inertial background electrons, hot suprathermal electrons (modeled by a
  ensuremathąppa-type distribution), and stationary ions. The plasma is penetrated
  by a cool electron beam component. A linear dispersion relation is derived to describe
  small- amplitude wave structures that shows a weak dependence of the phase speed
  on the electron beam velocity and density. A (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach
  is employed to obtain the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and
  investigate how their nonlinear structures depend on the kinematic and physical
  properties of the electron beam and the suprathermality (described by ensuremathp̨pa)
  of the hot electrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can largely alter
  the EAWs, but can only produce negative polarity solitary waves in this model. While
  the electron beam co- propagates with the solitary waves, the soliton existence
  domain (Mach number range) becomes narrower (nearly down to nil) with increasing
  the beam speed and the beam-to-hot electron temperature ratio, and decreasing the
  beam-to-cool electron density ratio in high suprathermality (low ensuremathkp̨a).
  It is found that the electric potential amplitude largely declines with increasing
  the beam speed and the beam-to-cool electron density ratio for co-propagating solitary
  waves, but is slightly decreased by raising the beam- to-hot electron temperature
  ratio.
