 abstract = {Suprathermal electrons and inertial drifting electrons, so called
electron beam, are crucial to the nonlinear dynamics of
electrostatic solitary waves observed in several astrophysical
plasmas. In this paper, the propagation of electron-acoustic
solitary waves (EAWs) is investigated in a collisionless,
unmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background
electrons, hot suprathermal electrons (modeled by a
\ensuremathąppa-type distribution), and stationary ions.
The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A
linear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-
amplitude wave structures that shows a weak dependence of the
phase speed on the electron beam velocity and density. A
(Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to obtain
the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and
investigate how their nonlinear structures depend on the
kinematic and physical properties of the electron beam and the
suprathermality (described by \ensuremath\p̨pa) of the hot
electrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can
largely alter the EAWs, but can only produce negative polarity
solitary waves in this model. While the electron beam co-
propagates with the solitary waves, the soliton existence domain
(Mach number range) becomes narrower (nearly down to nil) with
increasing the beam speed and the beam-to-hot electron
temperature ratio, and decreasing the beam-to-cool electron
density ratio in high suprathermality (low
\ensuremath\kp̨a). It is found that the electric potential
amplitude largely declines with increasing the beam speed and
the beam-to-cool electron density ratio for co-propagating
solitary waves, but is slightly decreased by raising the beam-
to-hot electron temperature ratio.},
