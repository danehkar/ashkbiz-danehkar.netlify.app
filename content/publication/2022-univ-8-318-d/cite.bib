 abstract = {The long-range gravitational terms associated with tidal forces, frame-
dragging effects, and gravitational waves are described by the
Weyl conformal tensor, the traceless part of the Riemann
curvature that is not locally affected by the matter field. The
Ricci and Bianchi identities provide a set of dynamical and
kinematic equations governing the matter coupling and evolution
of the electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor, so-called
gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields. A detailed analysis
of the Weyl gravitoelectromagnetic fields can be conducted using
a number of algebraic and differential identities prescribed by
the 1+3 covariant formalism. In this review, we consider the
dynamical constraints and propagation equations of the
gravitoelectric/-magnetic fields and covariantly debate their
analytic properties. We discuss the special conditions under
which gravitational waves can propagate, the inconsistency of a
Newtonian-like model without gravitomagnetism, the nonlinear
generalization to multi-fluid models with different matter
species, as well as observational effects caused by the Weyl
fields via the kinematic quantities. The 1+3 tetrad and 1+1+2
semi-covariant methods, which can equally be used for
gravitoelectromagnetism, are briefly explained, along with their
correspondence with the covariant formulations.},
