        local starburst Mrk 71 in NGC 2366 show emission apparently
        originating within the interior cavity around the dominant super

        Imaging Spectrograph far-ultraviolet spectroscopy, the
        morphology and intensity of the C IV nebular surface brightness
        and the C IV/He II ratio map provide direct evidence that the
        mechanical feedback is likely dominated by catastrophic
        radiative cooling, which strongly disrupts adiabatic superbubble
        evolution. The implied extreme mass loading and low kinetic
        efficiency of the cluster wind are reasonably consistent with
        the wind energy budget, which is probably enhanced by radiation
        pressure. In contrast, the Knot B SSC lies within a well-defined
        superbubble with associated soft X-rays and He II
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}1640 emission, which are signatures of
        adiabatic, energy-driven feedback from a supernova-driven
        outflow. This system lacks clear evidence of C IV from the limb-
        brightened shell, as expected for this model, but the
        observations may not be deep enough to confirm its presence. We
        also detect a small C IV-emitting object that is likely an
        embedded compact H II region. Its C IV emission may indicate the
        presence of very massive stars (>100 M

        observations of star-forming galaxies, they do not provide

        High Energy Transmission Grating (HETG) on the Advanced CCD
        Imaging Spectrometer S-array (ACIS-S) in 2005. Our thermal
        plasma modelling of the time-averaged HRC-S/LETG spectrum

        'high/soft' spectral states, which indicated higher plasma
        temperatures in the low/hard states of both the ACIS-S and
        HRC-S. The source also has a fluorescent iron emission line at
        6.4 keV, likely emitted from reflection off an accretion disc or
        dense absorber, which was twice as bright in the HRC-S epoch

        electrostatic solitary waves observed in several astrophysical
        plasmas. In this paper, the propagation of electron-acoustic
        solitary waves (EAWs) is investigated in a collisionless,
        unmagnetized plasma consisting of cool inertial background
        electrons, hot suprathermal electrons (modeled by a
        {\ensuremath{\kappa}}-type distribution), and stationary ions.
        The plasma is penetrated by a cool electron beam component. A
        linear dispersion relation is derived to describe small-
        amplitude wave structures that shows a weak dependence of the
        phase speed on the electron beam velocity and density. A
        (Sagdeev-type) pseudopotential approach is employed to obtain
        the existence domain of large-amplitude solitary waves, and
        investigate how their nonlinear structures depend on the
        kinematic and physical properties of the electron beam and the
        suprathermality (described by {\ensuremath{\kappa}}) of the hot
        electrons. The results indicate that the electron beam can
        largely alter the EAWs, but can only produce negative polarity
        solitary waves in this model. While the electron beam co-
        propagates with the solitary waves, the soliton existence domain
        (Mach number range) becomes narrower (nearly down to nil) with
        increasing the beam speed and the beam-to-hot electron
        temperature ratio, and decreasing the beam-to-cool electron
        density ratio in high suprathermality (low

        amplitude largely declines with increasing the beam speed and
        the beam-to-cool electron density ratio for co-propagating
        solitary waves, but is slightly decreased by raising the beam-

        expected locations of H I Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} absorption for
        a large sample of ultrafast outflows identified in XMM-Newton
        and Suzaku observations. Sixteen of the X-ray outflows have

        the bandpass of spectra from either the Far Ultraviolet
        Spectroscopic Explorer or the Hubble Space Telescope, although
        none of the archival observations were simultaneous with the
        X-ray observations in which ultrafast X-ray outflows (UFOs) were
        detected. In our spectra broad features with FWHM of 1000 km

        Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} features in the archival UV spectra
        indicates that the UFOs have very high ionization parameters,
        that they have very hard UV-ionizing spectra, or that they were

        (ADFs 2-3), which could be an indication of a tiny fraction of
        metal-rich inclusions embedded in the nebula (bi-abundance). In
        this work, we have constructed photoionisation models to
        reproduce the optical and infrared observations of the planetary
        nebula PB 8 using a non-LTE stellar model atmosphere ionising
        source. A chemically homogeneous model initially used cannot
        predict the optical recombination lines. However, a bi-abundance
        model provides a better fit to most of the observed optical
        recombination lines from N and O ions. The metal-rich inclusions
        in the bi-abundance model occupy 5.6\% of the total volume of
        the nebula, and are roughly 1.7 times cooler and denser than the
        mean values of the surrounding nebula. The N/H and O/H abundance
        ratios in the metal-rich inclusions are 1.0 and 1.7 dex larger

        Spitzer spectral energy distribution of PB 8, dust grains with a

        found that the presence of metal-rich inclusions can explain the
        heavy element optical recombination lines, while a dual-dust
        chemistry with different grain species and discrete grain sizes
        likely produces the infrared continuum of this planetary nebula.
        This study demonstrates that the bi-abundance hypothesis, which
        was examined in a few planetary nebulae with large abundance
        discrepancies (ADFs > 10), could also be applied to those

        nebula Abell 48 and its central star. We classify the nucleus as
        a helium-rich, hydrogen-deficient star of type [WN4-5]. The
        evidence for either a massive WN or a low-mass [WN]
        interpretation is critically examined, and we firmly conclude
        that Abell 48 is a planetary nebula (PN) around an evolved low-
        mass star, rather than a Population I ejecta nebula.
        Importantly, the surrounding nebula has a morphology typical of
        PNe, and is not enriched in nitrogen, and thus not the `peeled
        atmosphere' of a massive star. We estimate a distance of 1.6 kpc
        and a reddening, E(B - V) = 1.90 mag, the latter value clearly
        showing the nebula lies on the near side of the Galactic bar,
        and cannot be a massive WN star. The ionized mass
        ({\ensuremath{\sim}}0.3 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$) and electron
        density (700 cm$^{-3}$) are typical of middle-aged PNe. The
        observed stellar spectrum was compared to a grid of models from
        the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) grid. The best-fitting temperature
        is 71 kK, and the atmospheric composition is dominated by helium
        with an upper limit on the hydrogen abundance of 10 per cent.
        Our results are in very good agreement with the recent study of
        Todt et al., who determined a hydrogen fraction of 10 per cent
        and an unusually large nitrogen fraction of {\ensuremath{\sim}}5
        per cent. This fraction is higher than any other low-mass
        H-deficient star, and is not readily explained by current post-
        AGB models. We give a discussion of the implications of this
        discovery for the late-stage evolution of intermediate-mass
        stars. There is now tentative evidence for two distinct helium-
        dominated post-AGB lineages, separate to the helium- and carbon-
        dominated surface compositions produced by a late thermal pulse.
        Further theoretical work is needed to explain these recent
        discoveries.}",

        Abell 48 exhibits spectral features similar to massive nitrogen-
        sequence Wolf-Rayet stars. This raises a pertinent question,
        whether it is still a planetary nebula or rather a ring nebula
        of a massive star. In this study, we have constructed a three-
        dimensional photoionization model of Abell 48, constrained by
        our new optical integral field spectroscopy. An analysis of the
        spatially resolved velocity distributions allowed us to
        constrain the geometry of Abell 48. We used the collisionally
        excited lines to obtain the nebular physical conditions and
        ionic abundances of nitrogen, oxygen, neon, sulphur and argon,
        relative to hydrogen. We also determined helium temperatures and
        ionic abundances of helium and carbon from the optical
        recombination lines. We obtained a good fit to the observations
        for most of the emission-line fluxes in our photoionization
        model. The ionic abundances deduced from our model are in decent
        agreement with those derived by the empirical analysis. However,
        we notice obvious discrepancies between helium temperatures
        derived from the model and the empirical analysis, as
        overestimated by our model. This could be due to the presence of
        a small fraction of cold metal-rich structures, which were not
        included in our model. It is found that the observed nebular
        line fluxes were best reproduced by using a hydrogen-deficient
        expanding model atmosphere as the ionizing source with an
        effective temperature of T$_{eff}$ = 70 kK and a stellar
        luminosity of L$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ = 5500
        L$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, which corresponds to a relatively
        low-mass progenitor star ({\ensuremath{\sim}}3

        prominent, inclined central emission ellipse and faint bipolar
        extensions. It has two A-type stars in a proven binary system at
        the centre. However, the radiation from these two central stars
        is too soft to ionize the surrounding material leading to a so
        far fruitless search for the responsible ionizing source. Such a
        source is clearly required and has already been inferred to
        exist via an observed temporal variation of the centre-of-mass
        velocity of the A-type stars. Moreover, the ejected nebula is
        nitrogen rich which raises question about the mass-loss process
        from a likely intermediate-mass progenitor. We use optical
        integral-field spectroscopy to study the emission lines of the
        inner nebula ring. This has enabled us to perform an empirical
        analysis of the optical collisionally excited lines, together
        with a fully three-dimensional photoionization modelling. Our
        empirical results are used to constrain the photoionization
        models, which determine the evolutionary stage of the
        responsible ionizing source and its likely progenitor. The time-
        scale for the evolutionary track of a hydrogen-rich model
        atmosphere is inconsistent with the dynamical age obtained for
        the ring. This suggests that the central star has undergone a
        very late thermal pulse. We conclude that the ionizing star
        could be hydrogen deficient and compatible with what is known as
        a PG 1159-type star. The evolutionary tracks for the very late
        thermal pulse models imply a central star mass of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.64 M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, which
        originated from an {\ensuremath{\sim}}3
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ progenitor. The evolutionary time-
        scales suggest that the central star left the asymptotic giant
        branch about 25 000 yr ago, which is consistent with the
        nebula's age.}",
